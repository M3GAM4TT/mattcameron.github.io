# Hosting a Resume on GitHub Pages

## Purpose
This should explain the practical steps of how to host and format a resume using Markdown, a Markdown editor, GitHub Pages, and Jekyll. Additionally, there should be understandable links to the general principles of current Technical Writing according to Andrew Etter's book *Modern Technical Writing*.

## Prerequisites
You will need:
- A resume formatted in Markdown
- A GitHub account

## Getting Started with GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with name *username*.github.io, where *username* is your username. This can be done via the green 'New' button on the homepage, or via the '+' button next to your profile picture in the top right and selecting 'New repository'. (relates to Etter's book via distributed version control, elaborate)

2. Name your resume file `index.md`. (relates to Etter's book via distributed version control, elaborate)

3. Add your resume to the root of your GitHub repository. This can be done via 'Add file' on the repository webpage. (relates to Etter's book via distributed version control, elaborate)

## Building your Pages site with Jekyll

4. Click over to the 'Settings' tab on your repository, then scroll down to 'GitHub Pages' and enable it to build from your 'main' branch.

5. On the same page, immediately below the above step, there is a Theme Chooser which allows you to 'Choose a theme' from given Jekyll templates. Select this, and choose one of the given theme options.  
Note: You may want to add a custom theme, which can be done from the same place. However, this tutorial will not cover that.

1. "Why is Markdown better than a word processor?"
- Markdown has fewer settings and formatting options; it is simplified and at the same time standardized. As a result, everyone is able to create a similar type of documentation with a relatively small learning curve.
